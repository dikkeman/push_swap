# push_swap ðŸ”„ - Because Swap_push isnâ€™t as natural

### In Short
This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.
To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

#### Workflows to check Linux and macOS compilation:

### The rules

You have 2 stacks named stack a and b. <br>
At the beginning: <br>
- The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated.
- The stack b is empty. <br> <br>
#### The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the following operations at your disposal: <br>

  <p>
  <  sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements. <br>
  <  sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements. <br>
  <  ss: sa and sb at the same time. <br>
  <  pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of stack b and put it at the top of stack a. Do nothing if stack b is empty. <br>
  <  pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of stack a and put it at the top of stack b. Do nothing if stack a is empty. <br>
  <  ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one. <br>
  <  rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one. <br>
  <  rr: ra and rb at the same time. <br>
  <  rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1. The last element becomes the first one. <br>
  <  rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1. The last element becomes the first one. <br>
  <  rrr: rra and rrb at the same time. <br>
  </p>
